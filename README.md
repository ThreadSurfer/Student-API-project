"# Student-API-project" 
This project shows a fetch request to randomuser.me api.

From there, it fetches 12 random users (and all their data), and makes an interactive and dynamic contact list out of them.
The index.html will populate a screen full of interactive tiles, that a user may click for more info.

There is also a search bar, but I did not program it to work.
